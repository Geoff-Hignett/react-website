### What is Tailwind CSS?

On the official site Tailwind CSS is described as "A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup." So what does that mean? Basically, instead of writing out custom CSS for each component you write pre-existing classes (Tailwind classes) for each style that your HTML requires as you write the markup. This saves us building out large CSS files that grow as we progress through the build.
