### My Journey

Until 2018 I had been teaching English in Barcelona. When I returned to the UK I realised that this career was no longer for me and did some soul searching. I guess it was instinct and knowing that I should really consider becoming a programmer. I had studied Discrete Maths at school and was naturally a person who thought about how things worked behind the scenes (traffic light algorithms etc...). I had known what HTML was a long time ago but it looked pretty ugly to me so I never dabbled in web development. If I'd played around in HTML or JavaScript back then maybe I would have done this a long time ago.

I started learning the basics of **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** at **freeCodeCamp** and **Codeacademy** and quickly realised that I would probably enjoy doing this for a living. I still went through a weird phase of finding HTML boring and ugly compared to the other technologies but realised that once you are past the initial beginner stage very few problems that you spend time solving are related to HTML. It's simply the skeleton of your work. All the interesting things happen elsewhere. You can become an expert at HTML very quickly, whereas it will take years to master JavaScript or another programming language. I spent just over a year teaching myself and then found my first job at a digital agency. Since then I have worked as a front end developer and not looked back!

My path is known as the **self-taught** one. The other two main routes are doing a **computer science degree** or going on a **bootcamp**. Below are my thoughts on each of the options.

### Doing A Degree

In my opinion this is the right option for anyone approaching university age with a desire to go to university and work in a technical field. The advantage of this path is that you keep as many doors open as possible. By no means do you need a degree to be employed as a web developer. The majority of jobs do not require it. But there are some companies that exclusively hire computer science/engineering graduates. A few big-name organisations (a small % of the industry) are overscubsribed to the point that they can filter out anyone who doesn't appear perfect on paper. If you don't have a degree from a top university and you don't perform well in interviews with on-the-spot data structure/algorithm challenges then they can just hire someone who does both of these things.

As these companies are the most competitive, they have some of the best conditions/salaries and are fairly likely to use the latest technologies. So there isn't much sense in closing the door on these places if you are at the right stage in life to get a degree.
