### My Journey

Until 2018 I had been teaching English in Barcelona. When I returned to the UK I realised that this career was no longer for me and did some soul searching. I guess it was instinct and knowing that I should really consider becoming a programmer. I had studied discrete maths at school and was naturally a person who thought about how things worked behind the scenes (traffic light algorithms etc...). I had known what HTML was a long time ago but it looked pretty ugly to me so I never dabbled in web development. If I'd played around in HTML or JavaScript back then maybe I would have done this a long time ago.

I started learning the basics of **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** at **freeCodeCamp** and **Codeacademy** and quickly realised that I would probably enjoy doing this for a living. I still went through a weird phase of finding HTML boring and ugly compared to the other technologies but realised that once you are past the initial beginner stage very few problems that you spend time solving are related to HTML. It's simply the skeleton of your work. All the interesting things happen elsewhere. You can become proficient at HTML in a matter of days, whereas it will take years to master JavaScript or another programming language. I spent just over a year teaching myself and then found my first job at a digital agency. Since then I have worked as a front end developer and not looked back!

My path is known as the **self-taught** one. The other two main routes are doing a **computer science degree** or going on a **bootcamp**. Below are my thoughts on each of the options.

### Doing A Degree

In my opinion this is the right option for anyone approaching university age with a desire to go to university and work in a technical field. The advantage of this path is that you keep as many doors open as possible. By no means do you need a degree to be employed as a web developer. The majority of jobs do not require it. But there are **some companies that exclusively hire computer science/engineering graduates**. A few big-name organisations (a small % of the industry) are overscubsribed to the point that they can filter out anyone who doesn't appear perfect on paper. If you don't have a degree from a top university and you don't perform well in interviews with on-the-spot **data structure/algorithm** challenges then they can just hire someone who ticks both these boxes instead.

As these companies are the most competitive, they have some of the best conditions/salaries and are fairly likely to use the latest technologies. So there isn't much sense in closing the door on these places if you are at the right stage in life to get a degree. There are also some companies that aren't massive or well-known but still only hire graduates and there's nothing you can do about it. The same will be true in other industries. It's a bit of an old-school philosophy and who knows if it's to their detriment or not.

The main drawback of doing a CS degree is that **you will spend a lot of those 3 years learning theoretical and abstract programming**. You won't do much work that is similar to what you would do as a professional web developer so in terms of "job skill" you will be far behind practical learners in some regard. You also won't know for sure whether web development is for you unless you apply your programming knowledge outside of the curriculum in practical contexts. You could discover that you are incredibly strong academically but not as much in a real-world problem solving environment. So doing a degree is by no means the best choice for everyone.

### Teaching Yourself

If you have reservations about a degree, you have two options left really. And this is the best of the remaining options 90%-100% of the time. Teaching yourself online is a very common way to learn web development. **Anyone can do it for free**. There is enough tuition material on **YouTube/freeCodeCamp etc...** without spending a penny. Though if you pay a little (on **Udemy** when they have a sale, for example) you will find better-presented courses in my experience.

The advantages of self-tuition are obvious really. It's cheap/free, so you can dip your toes in the water and if you realise it's not for you then you haven't wasted lots of money. You can do it whenever you have time and plan it around your current job/hobbies. The pace is dictated by you, as is the syllabus. So if you know you want to be a React developer then you can concentrate on only the technologies relevant to that path.

One downside of this path is that you are more or less on your own and at times you will feel the pain of failing to understand why your code isn't working. This will happen again and again. It won't stop happening till long after you are good enough to find a job in fact, but it will test you the most right at the beginning of your journey. This could theoretically break you. It could make you feel like you aren't good enough to be a developer and lead you to give up. So if you have not gone through the process of learning something on your own then you should be aware of the low moments to come. But remember, **feelings of inadequacy or Imposter Syndrome** follow lots of great developers for years into their journeys, so don't let it make you think you can't be among the best.

### Doing A Bootcamp

This is the least common pathway into the industry. Basically you pay **a lot of money (around £5,000 - £10,000)** to go to "coding school". You are taught the fundamentals of web development over a period of months by industry professionals (or former professionals-turned instructors). In my opinion the biggest advantage of this is that spending a large amount of money will motivate you into making the most of your experience. You're unlikely to spend that much money on something you plan to coast through. Another advantage of this pathway is the expertise you are surrounded by. This can accelerate your progress, and you can also avoid going down bad practice routes. I would argue that this isn't an advantage for everyone as learning from your mistakes and building things on your own is the best way forward for a lot of people. Perhaps if you have low confidence in your ability then the extra support is what you need though.

The disadvantages of this are pretty obvious. It's a lot of money for something you could discover isn't for you. You also don't choose what you learn. Bootcamps teach specific technologies. If you start a front end bootcamp I would imagine you will cover the obvious things like HTML/CSS/JavaScript. But if you start a back end course you may end up spending 6 months learning Ruby, only to find out that you don't like Ruby and all the back end jobs near your town are Python-based. If you had gone down the self taught route you could have experimented with multiple technologies and discovered the one your're most passionate about. And as I mentioned above, going through pain is part of becoming a good programmer so the extra help you get from the instructors may end up preventing you from learning at the fastest pace because learning involves failing.

It's hard to describe the type of person I would recommend to do a bootcamp. If the cost of the course is significant for you then don't do one. If you havn't spent some time making sure you are actually interested in the reality of programming then don't do one. If you are the type of person who believes they can achieve success at this because of their motivation/talent then don't do one. Only do one if you are very rich or you know that you need to make a big commitment to put you in "motivation mode". And if you need that big commitment that is potentially a red flag in itself.

### TL;DR

If you are approaching university age or planning to go anyway, do a CS degree. If you aren't, teach yourself. If you are a multi-millionaire, do a bootcamp.
